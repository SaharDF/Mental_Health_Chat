Over time, this ethic has \\nbecome warped so that individuals put other peo-ple’s needs before their own (e.g., codependent personality). Saying no is mistakenly equated with rudeness, and doing so results in feelings of rejec-tion in the other person. But saying yes when it is inconvenient or impossible results in resentment and victimization in oneself. Assertive ness train-ing teaches people to say no without feeling guilty about hurting someone else’s feelings. People have the right to refuse a request without harboring feelings of guilt.</DOCUMENT>\\n<DOCUMENT>That will depend on how anxi ous you are\\nand how intensely you’re exerting yourself.
